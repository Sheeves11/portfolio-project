# Hello!!! - üíª

This is a fork of CVEINNT's LiveTerm that I have modified for use as a general-purpose portfolio website. This project is a Next.js based pesudo shell emulation (not to be confused with my project "Unnamed Fiefdom Game" which uses true shell emulation)

If you'd like to set up your own portfolio, feel free to follow the instructions below!

Building a simple website with LiveTerm is easy! After you've cloned this repository, simply run `yarn install && yarn dev` and start editing `config.json` to build your website!

LiveTerm can be used to build a variety of websites:

- [personal website](https://miaquain.art)
- [browser startpage](https://livetermstart.vercel.app/)
- [project page](https://liveterm.vercel.app/)
- or maybe just a cool browser music player...be creative!

Feel free to play with the web demo above!

## Setup Instructions

LiveTerm requires the `yarn` package manager. You can install `yarn` [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

Simply run the following commmand in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm/main/install/install.sh)"
```

This will install LiveTerm to the current directory. You can start building your website with:

```bash
cd LiveTerm && yarn dev
```

Start editing `config.json` and try saving and see the updated changes!

Alternatively, you can clone this repository to a location of your choosing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm.git && cd LiveTerm
```

Then install dependencies and start developing there:

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### Docker Usage

First, clone the project and edit `config.json` to your liking. Then run the following to start the container in the background:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

If you **know** what you were doing, you can also try changing `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`!
Learn more about Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/ 'here').

## üìÑ Configuration

### Basic Configuration

90% of LiveTerm's configurations are done through the `config.json` file.

```javascript
{
  "readmeUrl": // create a Github README and link it here!
  "title": // title of the website
  "name": // your name, included in 'about' command
  "ascii": // ascii art to display
  "social": {
    "github": // your handle
    "linkedin": // your handle
  },
  "email": // your email
  "ps1_hostname": "liveterm" // hostname in prompt
  "ps1_username": "visitor", // username in prompt
  "resume_url": "../resume.pdf", // path to your resume
  "non_terminal_url": "W",
  "colors": {
    "light": {
      ...
    },
    "dark": {
      ... // you can use existing templates in themes.json or use your own!
    }
  }
}
```

Feel free to change it as you see fit!

### Themes

You can find several pre-configured themes in `themes.json`, and you can replace the colors in `config.json` with the theme color you like! The themes are based on the themes on [this website](https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/).

For a better preview of the themes, checkout the images in the `demo` folder.

### Favicons

Favicons are located in `public/`, along with the other files you may want to upload to your website. I used this [website](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) to generate favicons.

### Banner

You may also want to change the output of the `banner` command. To do that, simply paste your generated banner in `src/utils/bin/commands.ts`. I used this [website](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/) to generate my banner.

### Advanced Configuration

If you want to further customize your page, feel free to change the source code to your liking!

## üåê Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

You can install `vercel` cli and follow the instruction [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview).

You can also connect your github account to vercel and have vercel automatically deploy the github repository for you.
